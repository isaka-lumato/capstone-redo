# Microverse HTML, CSS, JS Capstone Project

"This website is an announcement for the upcoming Launch event. The event will be held at Kimara Suka. General information about the event is given throughout the site. Speakers are introduced in a separate section."

The website content is fictional. It was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to meet the requirements defined within the scope of the Microverse Capstone project. In particular, I would like to point out that I built this website completely from scratch.
